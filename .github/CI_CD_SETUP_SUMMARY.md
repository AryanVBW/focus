   ```bash
   # Android
   cd Focus-app && ./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest
   
   # Website
   cd Focus-site && npm run build

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering:**
- Check if PR targets `main` or `develop`
- Verify workflow file syntax
- Ensure Actions are enabled in repo settings

**Build fails in CI but works locally:**
- Check Java/Node versions match
- Clear local caches and rebuild
- Review environment differences

**Screenshots not captured:**
- Verify website build succeeded
- Check preview server logs
- Ensure Playwright installed correctly

### Getting Help

1. Check the workflow logs
2. Review documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`
3. See troubleshooting guide in `.github/CONTRIBUTING_CI.md`
4. Create an issue with workflow run link

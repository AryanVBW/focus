# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the Focus Android app.

## üìã Available Workflows

### üöÄ Auto Release and APK Build (`auto-release.yml`)

**Trigger**: Push to `app-main` branch (excluding documentation files)

**What it does**:
1. Automatically bumps app version (patch increment)
2. Builds signed release APK (or debug if keystore not configured)
3. Creates GitHub release with detailed notes
4. Tags the release with semantic version
5. Uploads APK as artifact (90-day retention)

**Requirements**:
- GitHub secrets configured (see setup guide)
- Valid `app/build.gradle` with version info
- Android project structure

**Output**:
- GitHub Release with APK
- Version tag (e.g., `v2.0.1`)
- Workflow artifact
- Updated version in code

## üîß Configuration

- Check if changes are in ignored paths
- Ensure workflow file is valid YAML

### Build fails
- Check Actions logs for details
- Verify secrets are correctly set

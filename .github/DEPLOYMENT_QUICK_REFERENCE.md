- [ ] Version bumped in `app/build.gradle`
- [ ] Release notes updated in `.github/whatsnew/whatsnew-en-US`
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] All required secrets configured in GitHub

## üéØ Deployment Commands

### Internal Testing (Fastest)
```bash
# Create and push to internal release branch
git checkout -b release/internal
git push origin release/internal

# Or use manual workflow dispatch:
# GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Deploy to Google Play Console ‚Üí Run workflow
# Select: internal track
```

**Timeline**: Instant deployment, no review required  
**Audience**: Up to 100 internal testers  
**Use for**: Daily builds, quick testing

---

### Alpha Testing
```bash
# Create and push to alpha release branch
git checkout -b release/alpha
git push origin release/alpha

# Or manual dispatch with track: alpha
```

**Timeline**: Instant deployment, no review required  
**Audience**: Unlimited testers via opt-in link  
**Use for**: Weekly builds, feature testing

---

### Beta Testing
```bash
# Create and push to beta release branch
git checkout -b release/beta
git push origin release/beta

# Or manual dispatch with track: beta
```

**Timeline**: Instant deployment, no review required  
**Audience**: Unlimited testers via opt-in or email list  
**Use for**: Release candidates, pre-production testing

---

### Production Release
```bash
# Ensure version is bumped first!
# Edit app/build.gradle: versionCode and versionName

# Create and push version tag
git tag -a v2.0.5 -m "Release version 2.0.5"
git push origin v2.0.5

# Or manual dispatch with track: production
```

**Timeline**: 1-7 days for Google review  
**Audience**: All users  
**Use for**: Stable releases only

---

### Staged Production Rollout
```bash
# Use manual workflow dispatch:
# GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Deploy to Google Play Console ‚Üí Run workflow
# Track: production
# Rollout: 10 (for 10%)

# Increase rollout gradually:
# 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
```

**Best Practice**: Start with 10%, monitor for 24-48 hours, then increase

# Major version (2.1.0 ‚Üí 3.0.0)
./scripts/bump_version.sh major

# Commit and push
git add app/build.gradle
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 2.0.5"
git push
```

### Manual Version Edit
```gradle
// app/build.gradle
defaultConfig {
    versionCode 7        // Increment by 1

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied" during deployment
**Solution:** 
- Play Console → Settings → API access
- Find your service account
- Grant "Admin" or "Release Manager" permissions

### Issue 2: "Package not found"
**Solution:**
- Upload first release manually to internal track
- Automated deployments only work after first manual upload

### Issue 3: "Version code already used"
**Solution:**
- Edit `app/build.gradle`
- Increment `versionCode` (e.g., 9 → 10)
- Commit and push

### Issue 4: Workflow doesn't trigger
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check workflow syntax
gh workflow view play-store-deploy.yml

# Trigger manually
gh workflow run play-store-deploy.yml --ref release/internal -f track=internal
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Workflow

### How Automated Deployment Works

1. **You trigger deployment** (push to branch or manual trigger)
2. **GitHub Actions runs** the workflow
3. **Workflow builds AAB** using your signing key
4. **Workflow uploads to Play Console** using service account
5. **Play Console processes** the release
6. **Release becomes available** to testers/users

### Deployment Triggers

| Trigger | Command | Track |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Push to `release/internal` | `git push origin release/internal` | Internal |
| Push to `release/beta` | `git push origin release/beta` | Beta |
| Push tag `v*` | `git push origin v2.0.7` | Production |
| Manual | `gh workflow run ...` | Any track |

3. Test beta track deployment

### Soon (Recommended)
1. Complete store listing (screenshots, description)
2. Set up production track with staged rollouts
3. Configure deployment notifications
4. Document process for team

### Later (Optional)
1. Add automated testing before deployment

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always test locally first:**
   ```bash
   ./test-play-store-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Use internal track for testing:**
   - Deploy to internal first
   - Verify everything works
   - Then promote to beta/production

3. **Keep version codes incrementing:**
   - Never reuse a version code
   - Each release must have a higher version code

4. **Monitor deployments:**
   - Watch workflow runs: `gh run watch`
   - Check Play Console for errors
   - Review crash reports after release

5. **Use staged rollouts for production:**
   - Start with 20% rollout
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gradually increase to 100%

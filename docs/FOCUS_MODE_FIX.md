# Focus Mode Integration Fix

## Issue Identified
The Focus app was detecting and attempting to block short videos and reels content, but it wasn't properly checking if Focus Mode was enabled before executing the blocking action. This caused the app to either:
1. Not block content when Focus Mode was enabled, or
2. Block content even when Focus Mode was disabled

## Root Cause
In `FocusAccessibilityService.kt`, the enhanced content detection system was using this logic:
```kotlin
if (detectionResult.shouldBlock) {
    // Execute blocking immediately without checking Focus Mode
}
```

The `AppSettings.shouldBlockContent()` method exists and properly handles Focus Mode integration, but it wasn't being called in the main detection flow.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated FocusAccessibilityService.kt
Added proper Focus Mode check in the content detection logic:
```kotlin
// Before (line 261)
if (detectionResult.shouldBlock) {

// After (line 262-263)
// Check if content should be blocked based on Focus Mode and user settings
if (detectionResult.shouldBlock && appSettings.shouldBlockContent(packageName, detectionResult.contentType)) {
```

### 2. Cleaned up ContentDetectionCoordinator.kt
Removed duplicate `shouldBlockContent()` method that didn't consider Focus Mode, replacing it with a comment directing to the proper implementation in `AppSettings`.

## How Focus Mode Integration Works

The `AppSettings.shouldBlockContent()` method implements this logic:
```kotlin
fun shouldBlockContent(packageName: String, contentType: String): Boolean {
    val currentMode = getCurrentAppMode()
    
    // In focus mode, block based on content blocking settings
    if (currentMode == APP_MODE_FOCUS && isContentBlockingEnabled()) {
        return shouldBlockContentType(contentType) && isAppMonitored(packageName)
    }
    
    // In normal mode, don't block content
    return false
}
```

This ensures that:
1. Content is only blocked when Focus Mode is enabled (`APP_MODE_FOCUS`)
2. Content blocking feature is enabled (`isContentBlockingEnabled()`)
3. The specific content type should be blocked (`shouldBlockContentType()`)
4. The app is being monitored (`isAppMonitored()`)

## Testing the Fix

### Expected Behavior After Fix:
1. **Focus Mode Disabled**: Short videos and reels should NOT be blocked
2. **Focus Mode Enabled**: Short videos and reels SHOULD be blocked (if content blocking is enabled)

### Test Steps:
1. Disable Focus Mode in the app
2. Open Instagram/YouTube/TikTok and navigate to Reels/Shorts
3. Verify content is NOT blocked
4. Enable Focus Mode in the app
5. Open Instagram/YouTube/TikTok and navigate to Reels/Shorts
6. Verify content IS blocked

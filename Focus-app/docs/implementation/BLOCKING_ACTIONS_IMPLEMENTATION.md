# Blocking Action Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added new blocking action options to the Focus app that allow users to choose how the app responds when distracting content is detected.

## New Blocking Actions

### 1. Navigate Back (Default)
- **Behavior**: Simulates the back button to return user to previous screen
- **Use Case**: Gentle redirection away from distracting content
- **Implementation**: Uses `performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK)`
- **Advantages**: Less disruptive, maintains app state

### 2. Close App
- **Behavior**: Force stops the blocked app completely
- **Use Case**: More aggressive blocking to prevent re-entry
- **Implementation**: Uses `ActivityManager.killBackgroundProcesses()`
- **Advantages**: Stronger deterrent, completely removes temptation
- **Note**: May cause data loss if app wasn't saved

### 3. Lock Screen
- **Behavior**: Immediately locks device screen using DevicePolicyManager
- **Use Case**: Maximum disruption to break addiction habits
- **Implementation**: Requires Device Admin permission
- **Advantages**: Forces user to unlock device, strongest interruption
- **Note**: Requires Device Admin permission to be granted

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
1. **BlockingActionHandler.kt**: Core logic for executing different blocking actions
2. **FocusDeviceAdminReceiver.kt**: Device admin receiver for screen locking
3. **device_admin.xml**: Device admin policy configuration

#### Modified Files:
1. **AppSettings.kt**: Added blocking action preference management
2. **FocusAccessibilityService.kt**: Updated to use new blocking system
3. **SettingsFragment.kt**: Added UI for blocking action selection and testing
4. **preferences.xml**: Added blocking action preference
5. **strings.xml**: Added strings for new preferences
6. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Added device admin receiver and permissions

### Key Methods

#### BlockingActionHandler
- `executeBlockingAction()`: Main method that routes to appropriate action
- `closePlayer()`: Default back navigation
- `closeApp()`: Force stop app functionality
- `lockScreen()`: Device admin screen locking
- `isDeviceAdminEnabled()`: Check device admin status
- `requestDeviceAdminPermission()`: Request device admin access

#### FocusAccessibilityService Updates
- `executeBlockingAction()`: Wrapper for BlockingActionHandler with notifications
- `blockContentWithAction()`: Use user-selected action for blocking
- `redirectToSafeAppSection()`: Keep intelligent redirection for normal mode
- Enhanced Focus Mode vs Normal Mode handling

### User Experience

#### Settings UI
- New "Blocking Action" preference in General settings
- Test functionality to preview blocking actions
- Warning dialogs for destructive actions (Close App, Lock Screen)
- Helpful descriptions for each option

#### Behavioral Changes
- **Normal Mode**: Still uses intelligent redirection (tries to stay in app but navigate away from distracting content)
- **Focus Mode**: Uses user-selected blocking action for more aggressive blocking
- **Adult Content**: Always uses user-selected blocking action
- **Blocked Apps**: Uses user-selected blocking action

## Permissions Required

### Standard Permissions:
- `KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES`: For Close App functionality

### Optional Permissions:
- **Device Admin**: For Lock Screen functionality
  - User must manually enable in Android Settings
  - App will request permission when Lock Screen action is used
  - Falls back to Navigate Back if not granted

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Open Focus app settings
2. Go to "Blocking Action" preference
3. Choose desired action:
   - **Navigate Back**: Recommended for most users
   - **Close App**: For stronger deterrence
   - **Lock Screen**: For maximum disruption
4. Use "Test Blocking Action" to preview behavior
5. For Lock Screen: Grant Device Admin permission when prompted

### For Developers:
```kotlin
// Get current blocking action
val action = appSettings.getBlockingAction()

// Execute blocking action
blockingActionHandler.executeBlockingAction(packageName, action)

// Check if device admin is available for lock screen
val canLockScreen = blockingActionHandler.isDeviceAdminEnabled()
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions:
1. **Time-based Actions**: Different actions for different times of day
2. **App-specific Actions**: Different actions for different blocked apps
3. **Escalating Actions**: Progressively stronger actions for repeated violations
4. **Custom Actions**: User-defined actions or scripts
5. **Statistics Tracking**: Track effectiveness of different actions

### Technical Improvements:
1. **Accessibility Improvements**: Better VoiceOver/TalkBack support
2. **Performance**: Optimize blocking action execution
3. **Reliability**: Better fallback mechanisms
4. **Security**: Enhanced device admin security checks

## Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Navigate Back**: Should return to previous screen in social media apps
2. **Close App**: Should completely close the blocked app
3. **Lock Screen**: Should lock device (requires device admin)
4. **Fallback**: Should fall back to Navigate Back if primary action fails
5. **Permissions**: Should handle missing permissions gracefully
6. **Settings UI**: Should update summaries and show warnings appropriately

### Testing the Feature:
1. Use the "Test Blocking Action" button in settings
2. Open Instagram/YouTube and navigate to Reels/Shorts
3. Enable Focus Mode and open blocked apps
4. Test adult content blocking in browsers

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Default behavior remains unchanged (Navigate Back)
- Device Admin permission is optional and handled gracefully
- All blocking actions include appropriate user feedback (toasts/notifications)
- Error handling ensures app doesn't crash if actions fail

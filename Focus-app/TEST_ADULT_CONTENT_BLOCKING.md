# Test Plan: Adult Content Blocking Fix

## Bug Description
Previously, when adult content was detected in browsers, the app would launch a full-screen `BlockedPageActivity` that would eventually lead users to the home screen, making it appear as if the browser was "closed". This was inconsistent with social media content blocking, which simply uses back navigation.

## Changes Made
1. **Modified `checkAndBlockAdultUrl()` function** in `FocusAccessibilityService.kt`:
   - Replaced `startActivity(intent)` calls with `performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK)`
   - Added consistent toast notifications and logging like social media blocking
   - Added proper error handling

2. **Added documentation** to clarify different blocking strategies:
   - Content-specific blocking (adult content, reels, etc.) uses back navigation
   - Full app blocking in Focus Mode uses blocking page (intentionally disruptive)

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Adult Content Keyword Blocking
**Prerequisites:**
- Focus app accessibility service enabled
- "Block Adult Content" setting enabled in Focus app
- Chrome browser installed

**Steps:**
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to a URL containing adult keywords (e.g., type "adult content test" in address bar)
3. Verify that the browser simply navigates back instead of showing a full-screen block page

**Expected Result:**
- Browser should navigate back one page
- Toast notification: "Focus: Blocked adult content"
- User remains in Chrome browser

### Test 2: Adult Content Domain Blocking
**Prerequisites:**
- Same as Test 1

**Steps:**
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to a URL containing adult domains (check ADULT_DOMAINS list in code)
3. Verify back navigation behavior

**Expected Result:**
- Same as Test 1

### Test 3: Social Media Blocking (Regression Test)
**Prerequisites:**
- Focus app accessibility service enabled
- Instagram app installed
- Reels blocking enabled

**Steps:**
1. Open Instagram
2. Navigate to Reels section
3. Verify that blocking still works as before

**Expected Result:**
- Should navigate back within Instagram (not exit to home screen)
- Behavior should be unchanged from before the fix

### Test 4: Focus Mode Full App Blocking (Regression Test)
**Prerequisites:**
- Focus Mode enabled
- Instagram in blocked apps list

**Steps:**
1. Try to open Instagram while Focus Mode is active
2. Verify that the blocking page still appears (this should be unchanged)

**Expected Result:**
- Should show the BlockedPageActivity (this is intentional for Focus Mode)
- "Return to Home" button should work as before

## Verification Commands

### Build and Install
```bash
cd /Volumes/DATA_vivek/GITHUB/focus/Focus-app
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Monitor logs during testing
adb logcat -s FocusAccessibilityService
```

### Look for these log messages:
- `Adult keyword 'X' found in URL text: Y. Using back navigation.`
- `Adult domain 'X' found in URL host: Y. Using back navigation.`

## Success Criteria
✅ Adult content blocking uses back navigation (no full-screen blocking page)
✅ Consistent toast notifications and logging
✅ Social media blocking unchanged (regression test)
✅ Focus Mode full app blocking unchanged (regression test)
✅ No compilation errors
✅ App builds successfully

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: The change is minimal and only affects the adult content blocking mechanism
- **Backward Compatible**: No changes to app settings or user interface
- **Consistent**: Aligns adult content blocking with existing social media blocking behavior

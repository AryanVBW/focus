        <h3>Does Focus collect my data?</h3>

        <h2>Installation & Setup</h2>

        <h3>Why do I need to enable "Unknown Sources"?</h3>
        <p>Focus is distributed as an APK file from GitHub rather than through the Google Play Store. Android requires you to enable "Unknown Sources" to install apps from outside the Play Store.</p>

        <h3>What permissions does Focus need?</h3>
        <p>Focus requires several permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accessibility Service</strong>: To detect and block distracting content</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Stats</strong>: To track app usage time (optional)</li>
          <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps</strong>: To show blocking screens</li>
          <li><strong>Query All Packages</strong>: To show list of installed apps</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is it safe to grant Accessibility Service permission?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Focus uses the Accessibility Service only to detect specific content patterns in supported apps. The app is open-source, so you can review the code to see exactly how this permission is used.</p>

        <h2>Features & Usage</h2>

        <h3>What's the difference between Normal Mode and Focus Mode?</h3>
        <p><strong>Normal Mode</strong> allows you to use apps but blocks their most addictive features (like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts). <strong>Focus Mode</strong> completely blocks selected apps for a specified time period.</p>

        <h3>Can I customize which features are blocked?</h3>
        <p>Currently, Focus has predefined blocking rules for supported apps. Future versions will include more customization options.</p>

        <h3>Which apps does Focus support?</h3>

          <li>YouTube (blocks Shorts)</li>
          <li>Snapchat (blocks Stories and Spotlight)</li>
          <li>Web browsers (blocks adult content and social media sites)</li>
          <li>Complete blocking for any installed app in Focus Mode</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>Focus isn't blocking content. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Try these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure the Accessibility Service is enabled for Focus</li>
          <li>Restart the Focus app</li>
          <li>Restart your device</li>
          <li>Check that the app you're trying to use is supported</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The app crashes when I open it. How can I fix this?</h3>
        <p>Try these solutions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Clear Focus app data: Settings > Apps > Focus > Storage > Clear Data</li>
          <li>Restart your device</li>
          <li>Reinstall the app with the latest version</li>
          <li>Check that your Android version is 7.0 or higher</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Can I use Focus on multiple devices?</h3>
        <p>Currently, Focus works on individual devices only. Each device needs its own installation and configuration. Cloud sync may be added in future versions.</p>

        <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>

        <p>Even with future cloud features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All cloud features will be <strong>opt-in only</strong></li>
          <li>You can continue using Focus completely offline</li>
          <li>Any data sync will use <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong></li>
